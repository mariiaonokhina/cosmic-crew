# Cosmic Crew - a game about space
- Cosmic Crew is a game for people who are in love with space. 
- By using **WASD**  keys, the player must move their spaceship, while collecting coins and dodging the asteroids. 
- Failure to dodge an asteroid will result in a game over. 
- Also, if the player lets asteroids reach the bottom of the screen, it will result in a deduction of points and game over if the score goes below zero. 
- The user is able to prevent the asteroids reaching the bottom of the screen by pressing space bar to shoot.
- This game does not have an ending at this stage of the game.

Time spent: **30** hours spent in total

## Features:

- [X] **Colorful stars that move on the background**
- [X] **Coins that can be picked up by the user to increase score**
- [X] **Asteroids that appear randomly**
- [X] **Colliding with an asteroid will lead to game over**
- [X] **Asteroid hitting the bottom of the screen will result in point deduction**
- [X] **Clicking the next button displays a random new card**

## Planned features

- Bound the spaceship and asteroids as complex shapes instead of circles and rectangles
- Add planets that will be undestroyable but will destroy the spaceship
- Powerups, for example, red lasers that can destroy asteroids in a certain radius, speed boost, and time freeze
- Speed up the game and/or add move asteroids as the game progresses
- Add a certain goal for the player, like a quest
- Change of background as the game progresses, for example, new planets are added, galaxies, etc

## Notes

* Some challenges that I encountered included the collision logic. I made the spaceship from different shapes, which was very complicated to bound and check when it hits an asteroid or a coin. I used the following tutorial to implement collision detection. For simplicity, I approximated asteroids as circles, even though they are not perfect circles, and bounded the spaceship as a rectangle. The collision logic works, however, sometimes it detects a collision from being close to an asteroid due to the approximation of the shape.
	Another challenge I encountered is rendering asteroids that do not overlap. Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time on this; however, the asteroids still overlap sometimes, and I decided to leave it as it is in this alpha version of the game.
